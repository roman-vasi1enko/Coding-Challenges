// Task - Easy wallpaper
  // John wants to decorate the walls of a room with wallpaper. He wants a fool-proof method for getting it right.
  // John knows that the rectangular room has a length of l meters, a width of w meters, a height of h meters. The standard width of the rolls he wants to buy is 52 centimeters. The length of a roll is 10 meters. He bears in mind however, that itâ€™s best to have an extra length of wallpaper handy in case of mistakes or miscalculations so he wants to buy a length 15% greater than the one he needs.
  // Last time he did these calculations he got a headache, so could you help John?

  // Task
  // Your function wallpaper(l, w, h) should return as a plain English word in lower case the number of rolls he must buy.

  // Example:
  // wallpaper(4.0, 3.5, 3.0) should return "ten"
  // wallpaper(0.0, 3.5, 3.0) should return "zero"

  // Notes:
  // all rolls (even with incomplete width) are put edge to edge
  // 0 <= l, w, h (floating numbers); it can happens that w * h * l is zero
  // the integer r (number of rolls) will always be less or equal to 20
  // FORTH: the number of rolls will be a positive or null integer (not a plain English word; this number can be greater than 20)

  numbers = ["zero", "one", "two", "three", "four", "five", "six", "seven", "eight", "nine", "ten", "eleven", "twelve","thirteen", "fourteen", "fifteen", "sixteen", "seventeen", "eighteen", "nineteen", "twenty"]

    // Solution
    function wallpaper (length, width, height) {
      if (length === 0 || width === 0) return 'zero'
    
      const roomArea = 2 * (length + width) * height
      const rollArea = 0.52 * 10
    
      const rollsRequired = Math.ceil(roomArea / rollArea * 1.15)
      return numbers[rollsRequired]
    }

    // Tests
    consolee.log(wallpaper(6.3, 4.5, 3.29), "sixteen");
    consolee.log(wallpaper(7.8, 2.9, 3.29), "sixteen");
    consolee.log(wallpaper(6.3, 5.8, 3.13), "seventeen");
    consolee.log(wallpaper(6.1, 6.7, 2.81), "sixteen");
    consolee.log(wallpaper(0, 5.6, 3.20), "zero");
